# Nand2Tetris : Building a modern computer from first principles

This repository contains my implementation of the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) course.

## What is Nand2Tetris ?
[Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a hands-on online course created by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken that takes a bottom up approach to computer architecture.

The project starts with a single logic gate (NAND) and gradually builds a fully working computer system capable of running programs like Tetris.

The .hdl files in this repository are hardware description files. HDL was created by the makers of the course. It can be understood as a very simple Verilog.
